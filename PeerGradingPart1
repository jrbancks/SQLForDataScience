*****8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		
		Looking at the data review_count vs fans, there's no significant correlation between the 2 sets of numbers. It means that posting more reviews would mean a high number of fans.
		I extracted the table below and checked for correlation coeifficient. This resulted to a 0.29 which means it would be described as a weak positive association yet statistically significant.
