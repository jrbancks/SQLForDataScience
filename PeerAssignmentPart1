		+--------+--------------+

*****8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		
		Looking at the data review_count vs fans, there's no significant correlation between the 2 sets of numbers. It means that posting more reviews would mean a high number of fans.
		I extracted the table below and checked for correlation coeifficient. This resulted to a 0.29 which means it would be described as a weak positive association yet statistically significant.

PART 2:


*****1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	City: Las Vegas
	Category: Restaurants
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

		Answer: No. There's only a 1 hour gap between the 2 ratings. Jacques Cafe can be removed as part of analysis since it is no longer open. 10am-11pm vs 11am-12mn
		More reviews and higher ratings have been observed on the store that opened early and closed early (10am-11pm).
	
    SELECT * 
	FROM business b
    LEFT JOIN category c 
    LEFT JOIN hours h
	WHERE b.city ='Las Vegas' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.id = c.business_id AND b.id = h.business_id

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	
	I can only provide observations and no conclusive data that can be correlated for analysis. Maybe if I remove the filter on category OR increase the data coverage for "Restaurant" category,
	more analysis can be done BUT with the current filters, No.

SQL code used for analysis:

   SELECT * 
	FROM business b
    LEFT JOIN category c 
    LEFT JOIN hours h
	WHERE b.city ='Las Vegas' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.id = c.business_id AND b.id = h.business_id
